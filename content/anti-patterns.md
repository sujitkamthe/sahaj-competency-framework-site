Common traps that signal expectations may be set too high, or that you're overestimating how well you met them.

Use this section when **setting expectations** (are we being realistic?) and when **reflecting on feedback** (am I reading this correctly?). If multiple anti-patterns apply strongly, the expectations or your self-assessment may need adjustment.

## Explorer Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Learning ≠ Operating"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Confusing exposure with competence ("I've seen this before")
- Relying on step-by-step guidance but framing it as independence
- Completing tasks only when scope is tightly defined by others
- Needing frequent clarification but not recognising it as dependency
- Delivering outcomes that work only in the exact same conditions

### Red flags:

- Work stalls without close support
- You struggle to explain why something works
- You need rework when conditions change slightly

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Explorer-level expectations are more realistic than Artisan.

## Artisan Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Strong Execution ≠ Expanded Impact"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Mistaking high-quality delivery for broader ownership
- Being the "go-to person" for doing the work, not for making others better at it
- Solving the same problems repeatedly without eliminating root causes
- Waiting for direction, even when you could lead
- Equating seniority or tenure with Catalyst behaviour

### Red flags:

- Impact is limited to your own tasks or tickets
- You execute well but rarely shape the approach
- Teams depend on you to do, not to enable

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Artisan-level expectations are more realistic than Catalyst.

## Catalyst Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Helping ≠ Enabling at Scale"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Acting as a human bridge instead of fixing broken systems
- Being involved in many things, but owning few outcomes end-to-end
- Giving advice that is helpful but not adopted consistently
- Creating momentum that depends on your constant presence
- Confusing visibility with leverage

### Red flags:

- Things slow down when you step away
- Others still rely on you to connect dots
- Improvements don't survive beyond the project

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Catalyst-level expectations are more realistic than Multiplier or Amplifier.

## Multiplier Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Delegation ≠ Multiplication"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Delegating tasks without transferring context or judgment
- Mentoring individuals but not improving team capability overall
- Scaling yourself by adding meetings instead of removing friction
- Driving outcomes through personal authority rather than systems
- Confusing org-level exposure with org-level impact

### Red flags:

- Quality drops sharply without your oversight
- Teams execute because of you, not independently
- Success is fragile and person-dependent

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations are more realistic than Strategist.

## Amplifier Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Building Tools ≠ Scaling Impact"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Creating platforms or tools that solve your own problems, not the team's
- Building systems that require your involvement to maintain or evolve
- Confusing technical sophistication with actual adoption
- Writing documentation that clarifies for you but not for others
- Automating without measuring whether it actually saves time

### Red flags:

- Tools exist but aren't used consistently by the team
- Standards you set require constant enforcement
- Your artifacts need you to explain them

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Catalyst-level expectations are more realistic than Amplifier.

## Strategist Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Direction Setting ≠ Durable Strategy"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Producing narratives without changing execution reality
- Defining vision without aligning incentives or constraints
- Relying on charisma instead of structural clarity
- Making decisions that sound right but don't survive trade-offs
- Assuming long-term thinking without measurable outcomes

### Red flags:

- Strategy exists mostly in decks or conversations
- Teams interpret direction differently
- Results lag despite clear messaging

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations may be more realistic than Strategist.

## Pioneer Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Visibility ≠ Influence"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Speaking at events without changing how others think or work
- Writing thought leadership that impresses but doesn't get applied
- Building external reputation disconnected from internal contribution
- Confusing personal brand with organisational impact
- Innovating in isolation without bringing others along

### Red flags:

- External recognition exceeds internal reliance
- Ideas are admired but not adopted
- Innovation doesn't translate to capability others can use

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Amplifier-level expectations are more realistic than Pioneer.

## Universal Warning Signs

If you notice these patterns, pause and reassess:

- "I could do it if I were given the chance"
- "I do this informally, just not officially"
- "It worked once, so I count it"
- "People come to me a lot" (without sustained change following)
- "I'm already doing parts of the next persona"

**Reminder:** Occasional behaviour doesn't reflect where you operate. Consistency, durability, and reliance without prompting do.

## Final Self-Check

Before finalising expectations or your self-assessment, ask:

- If I stepped away for 3 months, what would **break** vs **persist**?
- Is my impact **person-dependent** or **system-dependent**?
- Would others describe me at this persona level **without hesitation**?

**Warning:** If the answer feels defensively justified rather than obvious, expectations may be set too high, or your self-assessment needs recalibration.
