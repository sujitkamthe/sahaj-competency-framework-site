title: Persona Anti-Patterns
---

Common self-overrating traps. Use this section to **stress-test your persona choice**. If multiple anti-patterns apply strongly to you, you are likely rating yourself one persona too high.

## Explorer Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Learning ≠ Operating"

### Common traps when rating yourself too high:

- Confusing exposure with competence ("I've seen this before")
- Relying on step-by-step guidance but framing it as independence
- Completing tasks only when scope is tightly defined by others
- Needing frequent clarification but not recognising it as dependency
- Delivering outcomes that work only in the exact same conditions

### Red flags:

- Work stalls without close support
- You struggle to explain why something works
- You need rework when conditions change slightly

**Verdict:** If this applies, you are still **Explorer**, not Artisan.

## Artisan Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Strong Execution ≠ Expanded Impact"

### Common traps when rating yourself too high:

- Mistaking high-quality delivery for broader ownership
- Being the "go-to person" because of availability, not leverage
- Solving the same problems repeatedly without eliminating root causes
- Waiting for direction, even when you could lead
- Equating seniority or tenure with Catalyst behaviour

### Red flags:

- Impact is limited to your own tasks or tickets
- You execute well but rarely shape the approach
- Teams depend on you to do, not to enable

**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Artisan**, not Catalyst.

## Catalyst Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Helping ≠ Enabling at Scale"

### Common traps when rating yourself too high:

- Acting as a human bridge instead of fixing broken systems
- Being involved in many things, but owning few outcomes end-to-end
- Giving advice that is helpful but not adopted consistently
- Creating momentum that depends on your constant presence
- Confusing visibility with leverage

### Red flags:

- Things slow down when you step away
- Others still rely on you to connect dots
- Improvements don't survive beyond the project

**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Catalyst**, not Multiplier.

## Multiplier Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Delegation ≠ Multiplication"

### Common traps when rating yourself too high:

- Delegating tasks without transferring context or judgment
- Mentoring individuals but not improving team capability overall
- Scaling yourself by adding meetings instead of removing friction
- Driving outcomes through personal authority rather than systems
- Confusing org-level exposure with org-level impact

### Red flags:

- Quality drops sharply without your oversight
- Teams execute because of you, not independently
- Success is fragile and person-dependent

**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Multiplier**, not Strategist.

## Strategist Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Direction Setting ≠ Durable Strategy"

### Common traps when rating yourself too high:

- Producing narratives without changing execution reality
- Defining vision without aligning incentives or constraints
- Relying on charisma instead of structural clarity
- Making decisions that sound right but don't survive trade-offs
- Assuming long-term thinking without measurable outcomes

### Red flags:

- Strategy exists mostly in decks or conversations
- Teams interpret direction differently
- Results lag despite clear messaging

**Verdict:** If this applies, you may still be **Multiplier**, not Strategist.

## Universal Over-Rating Signals

If you notice these patterns, pause and reassess:

- "I could do it if I were given the chance"
- "I do this informally, just not officially"
- "It worked once, so I count it"
- "People come to me a lot" (without evidence of sustained change)
- "I'm already doing parts of the next persona"

**Reminder:** Occasional behaviour does not define your persona. Consistency, durability, and reliance without prompting do.

## Final Self-Check

Before finalising your persona, ask:

- If I stepped away for 3 months, what would **break** vs **persist**?
- Is my impact **person-dependent** or **system-dependent**?
- Would others describe me at this persona level **without hesitation**?

**Warning:** If the answer feels defensively justified rather than obvious, you're likely one level too high.
