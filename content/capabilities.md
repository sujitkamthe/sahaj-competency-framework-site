title: Capability Areas
---

At Sahaj, expectations are described across five **capability areas**. These are best understood as **dimensions of impact**, not roles, grades, ratings, or levels. Capability areas are intentionally independent. Growth happens by **expanding impact across multiple areas over time**, not by maximising a single one.

This is not a scorecard. The radar shows where your impact currently shows up, not how good you are.
