title: Capability Areas
---

At Sahaj, expectations are described across five **capability areas**. These are best understood as **dimensions of impact**, not roles, grades, ratings, or levels. Capability areas are intentionally independent. Growth happens by **expanding impact across multiple areas over time**, not by maximising a single one.

This is not a scorecard. The radar shows where your impact currently shows up, not how good you are.

## How the Capability Areas Work Together

No single capability area is sufficient on its own.

- Strong **Technical Delivery** without Consulting leads to execution-only roles
- Strong **Consulting** without Technical depth erodes trust
- Strong **Delivery** without Mentorship creates bottlenecks
- Strong **Influence** without substance creates noise

Sustainable growth at Sahaj comes from **balanced expansion across capability areas over time**, with different capability areas becoming more prominent at different stages.

**Your weakest capability sets your ceiling.** If you demonstrate Artisan-level Technical Delivery but Explorer-level Consulting, you're operating as an Explorer overall — not an Artisan with a gap.

Early on, gaps are hard to see — the scope is smaller, the stakes are lower. Around Catalyst level, gaps become obvious. You're shaping direction, working with stakeholders, leading others. Blind spots show.
