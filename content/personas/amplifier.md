## Mindset

"My success is measured by the systems, platforms, and standards I create that multiply others' effectiveness."

**The question you're trusted to answer:** "What can I build that makes teams more effective?"

## Nature of Impact

- Team-level (through artifacts, not direct leadership)
- Capability multiplication via platforms, tools, and standards
- Technical depth with broad influence

## Explicit Expectation

- Creates platforms, tools, or standards that scale impact beyond direct involvement
- Owns technical direction without owning the team

## Why This Is Not the Easier Path

The IC track is not an escape from people work. Without team leadership as leverage, the bar is higher on shared capabilities:

- **Consulting**: Your artifacts must solve real problems. No one is assigned to use them. They must be compelling enough that teams choose to adopt them.
- **Communication**: Your work must be self-explanatory. You can't rely on meetings to drive adoption. Documentation, examples, and clarity must stand alone.
- **Mentorship**: You teach through what you build, not through direct coaching. The learning must be embedded in the artifact itself.

A Multiplier can delegate and direct. An Amplifier must create something good enough that people use it without being told to.

# Technical Delivery

## Expectations

- Defines technical direction for teams or programs
- Establishes shared patterns, libraries, and standards that teams adopt
- Builds platforms or accelerators reused across teams
- Improves developer productivity at scale through tooling and automation
- Prevents systemic technical debt across projects
- Reviews and influences designs beyond own team
- Drives large-scale refactoring or modernization initiatives
- Balances innovation with platform stability
- Anticipates future technical needs and risks
- Aligns technical strategy with business direction
- Acts as a technical escalation point for deep domain expertise
- Creates documentation and guidance that enables self-service adoption

## Self-Assessment

- Are multiple teams benefiting from what I've built?
- Do my platforms/tools reduce friction and enable others?
- Can teams succeed with my work without my constant involvement?

# Consulting

## Expectations

- Leads solutioning for complex, high-ambiguity technical problems
- Handles unclear or shifting technical requirements with confidence
- Translates business needs into platform and tooling strategies
- Anticipates how technical decisions will affect multiple teams
- Coaches others in technical problem-framing and architecture
- Navigates technical trade-offs across competing team needs
- Builds trust as the go-to expert in specific technical domains
- Shapes technical direction beyond immediate scope
- Represents Sahaj's technical depth to clients

## Self-Assessment

- Do teams seek my input for complex technical decisions?
- Are my recommendations adopted because of their merit?
- Can I help teams make better technical choices independently?

# Delivery Excellence

## Expectations

- Improves delivery health across teams through better tooling
- Introduces delivery practices and automation that stick
- Builds infrastructure that makes delivery more predictable
- Balances platform work with team delivery needs
- Reduces toil and manual work through systematic improvements
- Improves predictability at scale through better observability

## Self-Assessment

- Has delivery become easier because of what I've built?
- Do teams spend less time on friction and more on value?

# Mentorship & Talent Growth

## Expectations

- Develops technical talent through platforms that teach
- Creates learning materials, documentation, and examples
- Builds systems that raise the engineering bar automatically
- Coaches others on architecture, design, and technical depth
- Raises the overall technical capability bar through artifacts

## Self-Assessment

- Do people learn better practices by using what I've built?
- Am I raising the technical bar through my work?

---

# Communication & Influence

## Expectations

- Influences through technical artifacts and demonstrated results
- Represents Sahaj externally through talks, writing, and open source
- Shapes technical narratives and alignment through documentation
- Builds credibility through the impact of work, not position

## Self-Assessment

- Does my technical work speak for itself?
- Am I recognized for expertise, not authority?
