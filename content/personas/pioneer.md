## Mindset

"I shape the broader ecosystem through innovation, expertise, and thought leadership that extends beyond Sahaj."

**The question you're trusted to answer:** "How does Sahaj's expertise shape the broader ecosystem?"

## Nature of Impact

- Org-level / industry-level
- External influence and thought leadership
- Innovation at scale, creating paths others follow

## Explicit Expectation

- Creates org-level impact through external influence, innovation, and thought leadership
- Shapes how Sahaj is perceived in the broader technology ecosystem

## Why This Is Not the Easier Path

The IC track is not an escape from organisational work. Without account leadership as leverage, the bar is higher on shared capabilities:

- **Consulting**: Your ideas must prove themselves. No one is assigned to follow your direction. Your influence comes from the merit of your thinking, not your position.
- **Communication**: Your external reputation must translate to internal impact. Visibility without adoption is vanity. Thought leadership that doesn't change how Sahaj operates is not leadership.
- **Mentorship**: You inspire through example and visibility, not through direct relationships. The standard you set must be compelling enough that others aspire to it without being managed toward it.

A Strategist shapes direction through accounts and relationships. A Pioneer must create ideas and innovations compelling enough that the organisation and industry follow without being led.
