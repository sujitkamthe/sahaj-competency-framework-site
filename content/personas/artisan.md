## Mindset

"I can deliver high-quality work independently and understand the context around it."

**The question you're trusted to answer:** "What's the right way to build this?"

## Nature of Impact

- Individual → local team
- Feature-level ownership
- Craft excellence emerges

## Success Looks Like

- Strong engineering fundamentals
- Reliable delivery
- Beginning to influence solutions, not just implement them

# Technical Delivery

## Expectations

- Independently implements stories end-to-end
- Breaks down stories into logical implementation steps
- Writes clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Applies SOLID principles and common design patterns where appropriate
- Writes unit and integration tests by default
- Uses meaningful naming and structure
- Debugs functional, integration, and environment issues independently
- Works across backend, frontend, data pipelines, and infra as needed
- Understands service boundaries and data flows
- Reviews peers' PRs with specific, actionable feedback
- Refactors code opportunistically while delivering features
- Understands basic performance bottlenecks
- Uses logs, metrics, and alerts effectively
- Follows secure coding practices
- Keeps implementation aligned with agreed design and acceptance criteria
- Takes responsibility for defects introduced by their code

## Self-Assessment

- Would someone unfamiliar with the code understand it easily?
- Do I improve code quality even when not explicitly asked?
- Can I explain why I chose this implementation?
