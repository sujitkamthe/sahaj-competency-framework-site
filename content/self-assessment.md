title: How to Do Your Self-Assessment
---

This framework is designed to support **honest reflection**, not optimistic self-rating. The goal is to help you clearly identify where you operate today, not where you aspire to be.

> You will choose **one persona only** and then assess how consistently you demonstrate that persona across capability areas.

## Step 1: Choose Your Current Persona (Single Choice)

Choose one persona that best describes how you operate **most of the time**, across your role.

**Warning:** Do not choose aspirationally. Choose the persona whose behaviours you already demonstrate consistently and without prompting.

### Personas (from early to advanced)

- **Explorer**: Learning the fundamentals, contributing with guidance
- **Artisan**: Reliable individual contributor with strong execution
- **Catalyst**: Expands impact beyond own work; enables teams
- **Multiplier**: Scales impact through people, systems, and decisions
- **Strategist**: Shapes direction, priorities, and long-term outcomes

It is expected that growth through these personas is sequential.

### Ask yourself:

- Where do I operate most of the time, not occasionally?
- Where do others rely on me without prompting?
- If my role stayed the same for 6 months, which persona would still describe me?

**Important:** You must select exactly one persona. You will not choose different personas for different capability areas.

## Step 2: Assess Yourself Against That Persona

Once you've chosen your persona, assess how well you demonstrate that persona's expectations across all relevant **Capability Areas** (Technical Delivery, Consulting, Delivery Excellence, Mentorship, Influence).

### You are NOT asking:
"What is my level in this area?"

### You ARE asking:
"How consistently do I demonstrate the behaviours expected of my chosen persona in this area?"

## Step 3: Gather Evidence (Not Effort)

For each Capability Area, list concrete evidence that shows you operating at your chosen persona level.

### Focus on:
- Outcomes you owned
- Decisions you influenced
- Problems that stopped recurring because of you
- People who grew or succeeded because of your involvement

### Avoid:
- Intent ("I try to...", "I aim to...")
- Effort ("I worked hard...", "I spent many hours...")
- One-off heroics or exceptional circumstances

**If you struggle to find evidence, that is a signal, not a failure.**

## Step 4: Rate Yourself Honestly (Per Capability Area)

Using the definitions below, rate yourself for each Capability Area, relative to your chosen persona.

### Below Expectations

- You demonstrate some behaviours of the persona, but not most
- Impact is inconsistent, fragile, or dependent on others
- Outcomes rely on favourable conditions
- You often need reminders, escalation, or rescue

**Guiding questions:**
- Would this area stall without support?
- Do others compensate for gaps I haven't closed yet?

### Meets Expectations

- You demonstrate most behaviours consistently
- Impact is reliable and repeatable
- Others trust you to own this area without supervision
- You deliver outcomes across different contexts

**Guiding questions:**
- Would people confidently depend on me here?
- Does this show up beyond one project or team?

### Exceeds Expectations

- You raise the bar for this area at your persona level
- Others learn by watching or working with you
- Your impact extends beyond your immediate scope
- Problems stop recurring due to structural improvements you introduced

**Guiding questions:**
- Are others changing how they work because of me?
- Would this area noticeably weaken if I stepped away?

## Step 5: Look for Imbalance

Your persona choice should be supported across capability areas.

### Key principles:

- Strong Technical Delivery is **mandatory**, but insufficient for growth
- Exceeding expectations in one area **does not compensate** for being below in another
- Persistent gaps signal a growth ceiling, regardless of strengths elsewhere

### Examples:

| Pattern | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Strong Technical Delivery + weak Consulting | Catalyst ceiling |
| Strong Execution + weak Mentorship | Multiplier ceiling |
| Strong Influence + weak Delivery Excellence | Credibility risk |

**Growth requires broadening impact, not maximising a single strength.**

## Step 6: Validate Externally

Before finalising your assessment:

### Ask peers:
- "Where do you see my strongest impact?"
- "Where do you rely on me without needing follow-ups?"

### Ask leads:
- "Where do I consistently operate without support?"
- "Where would my absence be felt most?"

Look for **patterns**, not isolated comments.

**Warning:** If your self-assessment is meaningfully higher than the feedback, trust the feedback.

## Explicit Growth Principle

**Strong Technical Delivery is mandatory but not sufficient.**

### Growth beyond Artisan requires:
- Consulting
- Delivery Excellence

### Growth beyond Catalyst requires:
- Mentorship
- Influence
- System-level thinking

Persona advancement reflects **how far your impact travels**, not how good you are at a single thing.
