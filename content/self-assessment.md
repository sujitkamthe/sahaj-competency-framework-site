title: How to Do Your Self-Assessment
---

This framework is designed to support **honest reflection**, not optimistic self-rating. The goal is to summarize your understanding of feedback you've received, not to claim a level or build a case.

## How This Process Works

Your self-assessment is a starting point, not a conclusion.

Throughout your work, you receive feedback from teammates, leads, and stakeholders. This self-assessment is where you reflect on that feedback and show how you've processed it. The question isn't "what level am I?" It's "did I meet the expectations my team set with me, and did I understand my feedback correctly?"

After you complete your assessment, teammates from your project and office will respond. They'll confirm your understanding, correct misreadings, or add perspective you may have missed. You'll do the same for them. This is mutual calibration, not one-way review.

Everyone in your office sees these assessments. This transparency means overstating doesn't work: your teammates know your work. It also means you can be honest about uncertainty. Saying "I'm not sure I've read this right" invites useful correction. Treating it as a case to defend invites scrutiny.

## Before You Begin

Self-assessment depends on expectations that were set earlier. If you and your teammates haven't discussed what's expected of you, [do that first](#home/setting-expectations-comes-first). Without clear expectations, self-assessment becomes guesswork.

## Step 1: Recall Your Expectations

Before rating yourself, be clear on what was expected.

What did you and your teammates agree you'd be responsible for? What outcomes, behaviours, or ownership were you expected to demonstrate? If you used this field guide during expectation-setting, which persona served as the reference point?

If you're unsure, check with your teammates before proceeding. Self-assessment against unclear expectations produces unclear results.

## Step 2: Reflect on Your Feedback

Think about the feedback you've received since expectations were set.

- What have teammates, leads, or stakeholders told you, directly or indirectly?
- Where have you heard consistent themes?
- What's changed in how others rely on you?

This step is about listening, not advocating. Your self-assessment should demonstrate that you've heard and processed what others have observed.

## Step 3: Rate Yourself Honestly

For each capability area relevant to your expectations, rate yourself: **Below Expectations**, **Meets Expectations**, or **Exceeds Expectations**.

You're rating against what was agreed with your team, not against a generic persona definition.

### Below Expectations

- You delivered some of what was expected, but not most
- Impact was inconsistent or required support from others
- Outcomes depended on favourable conditions
- You needed reminders, escalation, or rescue

**Ask yourself:**
- Would this area have stalled without help?
- Did others compensate for gaps I hadn't closed?

### Meets Expectations

- You delivered what was expected, consistently
- Impact was reliable and repeatable
- Others trusted you to own this area without supervision
- You handled varied conditions, not just ideal ones

**Ask yourself:**
- Would teammates confidently depend on me here?
- Did I deliver without needing to be checked on?

### Exceeds Expectations

- You went beyond what was expected
- Others learned from watching or working with you
- Your impact extended past your immediate scope
- Problems stopped recurring because of improvements you introduced

**Ask yourself:**
- Did I raise the bar, not just meet it?
- Would this area weaken noticeably if I stepped away?

## Step 4: Summarize Your Understanding

For each area, briefly describe:

- What you understood was expected
- What feedback you received
- How you performed against expectations
- Any uncertainty or questions you have

This summary is material for conversation. It shows teammates how you've processed your feedback so they can confirm, correct, or add nuance.

## Step 5: Look for Imbalance

Your expectations likely span multiple capability areas. Check for patterns.

- Are you consistently meeting expectations across areas, or strong in some and weak in others?
- Persistent gaps signal a ceiling, regardless of strengths elsewhere
- Exceeding in one area doesn't compensate for being below in another

If you notice imbalance, name it. It's useful information for the calibration conversation.

## Step 6: Share and Calibrate

Your self-assessment goes to your teammates and office. They'll review it and respond.

**Expect:**
- Confirmation where your understanding matches theirs
- Correction where you've misread feedback
- Additional perspective you may have missed

**You'll do the same for them.** Review their self-assessments. Confirm, challenge, or add nuance based on your experience working with them.

This mutual calibration is where clarity emerges, not from your self-assessment alone.

## Common Traps

### Overstating

If your self-assessment is higher than what feedback suggested, you'll hear about it. In an open system, your teammates know your work. Trust their perspective.

### Understating

Some people default to "below expectations" out of modesty. If feedback was positive, reflect that. Underselling creates calibration work for others.

### Defending Instead of Reflecting

If you find yourself building a case or justifying, pause. The goal is to show you understood your feedback, not to argue you deserved better.

### Missing the Conversation

Self-assessment without the follow-up conversation is incomplete. The assessment is a starting point. Calibration is where it becomes useful.
