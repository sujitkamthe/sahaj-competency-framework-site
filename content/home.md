tagline: Clarity without hierarchy. Impact over titles.

## How to Read These Expectations

At Sahaj, we believe that **great software engineering is inseparable from thinking, ownership, and human judgment**. We are a technology consulting organisation, not a feature factory. Our work succeeds when we solve the *right* problems well, not merely when we deliver what is asked.

This competency framework exists to create **clarity without hierarchy**. We intentionally do not use formal titles or grades. Instead, we describe **how impact evolves over time**—from learning and contributing safely, to shaping direction, building trust, and growing others.

## What We Value

### Technical Excellence as a Baseline, Not a Differentiator

Clean code, strong design, testing, and sound engineering practices are expected at every stage. Technical depth is necessary, but by itself it is not enough for long-term growth.

### Ownership Over Output

We value people who take responsibility for outcomes—technical, delivery, client, and organisational—not just for completing tasks.

### Consulting Mindset

Sahaj engineers are expected to think like consultants: to understand problems deeply, remove ambiguity, propose solutions, and help stakeholders make better decisions. Doing what is asked without questioning unclear or risky assumptions has a natural growth ceiling.

### Delivery Excellence, Not Heroics

Sustainable, predictable delivery matters more than speed or firefighting. We optimize for long-term health of teams and systems.

### People and Culture as First-Class Responsibilities

Growing others, building trust, and strengthening teams are not "extra" activities. They are core to how impact scales at Sahaj.

### Transparency and Trust

In a culture with open conversations and open salaries, expectations must be explicit, observable, and fair. This framework is designed to make growth paths visible and to support honest self-assessment.

## How to Use This Framework

- This is **not a checklist** and not everyone will excel in all areas at once.
- Expectations **increase in depth and scope**, not simply in quantity of work.
- Growth happens by **expanding impact across multiple dimensions** over time.
- Each section includes prompting questions to help with **unbiased self-reflection**, focused on outcomes rather than effort.

Most importantly, this framework is meant to support **adult conversations**—about growth, impact, and contribution—without hiding behind titles, years of experience, or vague notions of seniority.

## How the Capability Areas Work Together

No single capability area is sufficient on its own.

- Strong **Technical Delivery** without Consulting leads to execution-only roles
- Strong **Consulting** without Technical depth erodes trust
- Strong **Delivery** without Mentorship creates bottlenecks
- Strong **Influence** without substance creates noise

Sustainable growth at Sahaj comes from **balanced expansion across capability areas over time**, with different capability areas becoming more prominent at different stages.

## Key Truths

- Delivery-only excellence has a **growth ceiling**
- Consulting is the **primary differentiator** beyond Artisan
- Seniority is demonstrated by **sustained impact**, not effort
- You are not expected to excel in everything at once
- Growth is about expanding impact across buckets over time

## How to Self-Assess Honestly

- Look for **outcomes**, not activity
- Ask: *What changed because of me?*
- If your evidence is mostly effort, you're likely overestimating
- Use feedback from peers and stakeholders to validate self-view

## Explicit Growth Principle

**Strong Technical Delivery is mandatory but insufficient for long-term growth.** Growth beyond Artisan requires demonstrated capability in Consulting and Delivery Excellence, supported by Mentorship and Influence.
