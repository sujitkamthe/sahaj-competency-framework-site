## What This Guide Is For

This is a shared vocabulary for talking about growth at Sahaj. It describes **how impact evolves over time**: from learning and contributing safely, to shaping direction, building trust, and growing others.

We intentionally do not use formal titles or grades. This guide exists to create **clarity without hierarchy**, to make growth paths visible, and to support honest conversations about expectations and feedback.

## Growth Is Self-Directed

Sahaj is an open field. You choose which direction to go, what skills to build, and how quickly to build them, based on your choices and the opportunities you prioritize.

Some people struggle to see the field. Some struggle to see the paths others have already cut through the grass. This guide attempts to show those paths: common patterns of growth that have worked for others.

But this is not the only way to grow. All paths that create impact are valued. Use this as a starting point if you can't see a path forward, not as a constraint on where you can go.

## How to Use This Guide

This guide supports conversations, not conclusions. Use it when:

- **Setting expectations**: Discuss with teammates what's expected of you, using personas as a reference point.
- **Giving and receiving feedback**: Reference capability areas to make feedback specific and actionable.
- **Reflecting on growth**: Understand where your impact shows up and where gaps might exist.

This is **not a checklist**. Expectations increase in depth and scope, not simply in quantity of work.

### Setting Expectations Comes First

Before feedback or self-assessment can happen, **expectations must be set**.

This is a conversation between you and your teammates. Use this guide as a reference point, not a rigid template:

> "I'm expecting you to own stories end-to-end, ask why behind the work (not just how), and flag risks early, which is roughly what I'm visualising as an Artisan for our team."

Expectations may differ from the guide based on your team's context. Some areas may need more depth, others less. What matters is that expectations are **explicit and agreed**, not assumed.

If expectations were never made explicit, that's a gap to address first. Implicit expectations cause trouble: during feedback, during self-assessment, and during calibration.

### The Flow

1. **Expectations are set**: using this guide as a reference
2. **Work happens**: with ongoing feedback against those expectations
3. **Self-assessment**: you reflect on feedback and summarize your understanding
4. **Calibration**: teammates confirm, correct, or add perspective

Each step depends on the previous one. Self-assessment without clear expectations is guesswork. Feedback without shared vocabulary is inconsistent.

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is designed for **people in delivery roles**: engineers, tech leads, and those building products for clients.

If you're in a different role (operations, sales, design, etc.), some principles may apply, but the specific expectations won't map directly. **We're working on expanding coverage.** For now, talk to your office lead about growth paths for your role.

## What We Value

### Technical Excellence as a Baseline, Not a Differentiator

Clean code, strong design, testing, and sound engineering practices are expected at every stage. Technical depth is necessary, but by itself it is not enough for long-term growth.

### Ownership Over Output

We value people who take responsibility for outcomes (technical, delivery, client, and organisational), not just for completing tasks.

### Consulting Mindset

Sahajeevis are expected to think like consultants: to understand problems deeply, remove ambiguity, propose solutions, and help stakeholders make better decisions. Doing what is asked without questioning unclear or risky assumptions has a natural growth ceiling.

### Delivery Excellence, Not Heroics

Sustainable, predictable delivery matters more than speed or firefighting. We optimize for long-term health of teams and systems.

### People and Culture as First-Class Responsibilities

Growing others, building trust, and strengthening teams are not "extra" activities. They are core to how impact scales at Sahaj.

### Transparency and Trust

In a culture with open conversations and open salaries, expectations must be explicit, observable, and fair.

## Key Truths

- Delivery-only excellence has a **growth ceiling**
- All five capabilities matter; **Consulting is where calibration is hardest** (everyone thinks they consult; few actually do)
- Seniority is demonstrated by **sustained impact**, not effort
- You are not expected to excel in everything at once
- Growth is about expanding impact across capabilities over time
- Self-assessment is about **processing feedback**, not claiming a level
- **Strong Technical Delivery is mandatory but insufficient** for long-term growth
