## How to Read These Expectations

At Sahaj, we believe that **great software engineering is inseparable from thinking, ownership, and human judgment**. We are a technology consulting organisation, not a feature factory. Our work succeeds when we solve the *right* problems well, not merely when we deliver what is asked.

This competency framework exists to create **clarity without hierarchy**. We intentionally do not use formal titles or grades. Instead, we describe **how impact evolves over time**: from learning and contributing safely, to shaping direction, building trust, and growing others.

## What We Value

### Technical Excellence as a Baseline, Not a Differentiator

Clean code, strong design, testing, and sound engineering practices are expected at every stage. Technical depth is necessary, but by itself it is not enough for long-term growth.

### Ownership Over Output

We value people who take responsibility for outcomes (technical, delivery, client, and organisational), not just for completing tasks.

### Consulting Mindset

Sahajeevis are expected to think like consultants: to understand problems deeply, remove ambiguity, propose solutions, and help stakeholders make better decisions. Doing what is asked without questioning unclear or risky assumptions has a natural growth ceiling.

### Delivery Excellence, Not Heroics

Sustainable, predictable delivery matters more than speed or firefighting. We optimize for long-term health of teams and systems.

### People and Culture as First-Class Responsibilities

Growing others, building trust, and strengthening teams are not "extra" activities. They are core to how impact scales at Sahaj.

### Transparency and Trust

In a culture with open conversations and open salaries, expectations must be explicit, observable, and fair. This framework is designed to make growth paths visible and to support honest self-assessment.

## How to Use This Framework

This guide supports conversations, not conclusions. Use it when:

- **Setting expectations**: Discuss with teammates what's expected of you, using personas as a reference point.
- **Giving and receiving feedback**: Reference capability areas to make feedback specific and actionable.
- **Reflecting on growth**: Understand where your impact shows up and where gaps might exist.

This is **not a checklist**. Expectations increase in depth and scope, not simply in quantity of work. Growth happens by expanding impact across multiple dimensions over time.

Most importantly, this framework is meant to support **thoughtful, self-owned conversations** about growth, impact, and contribution, without hiding behind titles, years of experience, or vague notions of seniority.

### Setting Expectations Comes First

Before feedback or self-assessment can happen, **expectations must be set**.

This is a conversation between you and your teammates. Use this guide as a reference point, not a rigid template:

> "I'm expecting you to be able to take care of things like A, B, C, which is roughly what I'm visualising as an Artisan for our team."

Expectations may differ from the guide based on your team's context. Some areas may need more depth, others less. What matters is that expectations are **explicit and agreed**, not assumed.

If expectations were never made explicit, that's a gap to address first. Implicit expectations cause trouble: during feedback, during self-assessment, and during calibration. This guide should help make those conversations easier and more consistent.

### The Flow

1. **Expectations are set**: using this guide as a reference
2. **Work happens**: with ongoing feedback against those expectations
3. **Self-assessment**: you reflect on feedback and summarize your understanding
4. **Calibration**: teammates confirm, correct, or add perspective

Each step depends on the previous one. Self-assessment without clear expectations is guesswork. Feedback without shared vocabulary is inconsistent.

## Key Truths

- Delivery-only excellence has a **growth ceiling**
- All five capabilities matter; **Consulting is where calibration is hardest** (everyone thinks they consult; few actually do)
- Seniority is demonstrated by **sustained impact**, not effort
- You are not expected to excel in everything at once
- Growth is about expanding impact across capabilities over time

## Who This Guide Is For

This guide is designed for **people in delivery roles**: engineers, tech leads, and those building products for clients.

If you're in a different role (operations, sales, design, etc.), some principles may apply, but the specific expectations won't map directly. **We're working on expanding coverage.** For now, talk to your office lead about growth paths for your role.

## Honest Reflection

- Self-assessment is about **processing feedback**, not claiming a level
- Ask: *Did I understand what others told me?*
- Focus on **outcomes**, not activity: what changed because of you?
- If your teammates would describe your impact differently than you do, trust their perspective

## Explicit Growth Principle

**Strong Technical Delivery is mandatory but insufficient for long-term growth.** Growth beyond Artisan requires demonstrated capability in Consulting and Delivery Excellence, supported by Mentorship and Influence.
