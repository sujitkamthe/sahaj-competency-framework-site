This page collects common questions about how the guide works, plus warning signs that expectations may be set too high.

## Common Questions

### Are Personas Assigned to Me?

No. Personas aren't labels you receive. They're vocabulary for setting expectations.

When teammates set expectations with you, they might say: "I'm expecting roughly Artisan-level ownership on this project." That's a reference point, not a designation.

Expectations get customized to your context: your team, your project, your growth areas. The persona helps communicate the general shape; the specifics are agreed between you and your teammates.

You don't "become" a Catalyst. You and your team agree on expectations that look like Catalyst-level impact in your situation.

### What if I Don't Want to Lead Teams?

People leadership is not a requirement for growth at Sahaj. You can grow as an individual contributor by expanding impact in other ways:

- Shaping technical direction across teams (not just your own code)
- Mentoring through pairing, reviews, and knowledge sharing (not managing)
- Influencing decisions through clarity and trust (not authority)

Multiplier-level impact doesn't require direct reports. It requires that others become more effective because of you, whether through systems, standards, or skill transfer.

### What if I Switched Domains or Tech Stacks?

You don't start over, but some capabilities reset faster than others.

Technical Delivery may dip temporarily as new languages, tools, and patterns take time. But Consulting, Delivery Excellence, Mentorship, and Communication often transfer. You still know how to remove ambiguity, ship reliably, and help others grow.

Expect adjustment, not reset. The question is: which capabilities stayed strong, and which need rebuilding?

### How Does This Relate to Salary?

This guide describes impact, not compensation. Persona levels are a vocabulary for setting expectations and giving feedback, not a pay grade.

Salary decisions involve more factors: market rates, tenure, role scope, business context. They happen in a separate conversation.

If you're using this guide to justify a raise, pause. Assess your impact honestly first. Compensation follows from sustained, recognized impact, not from claiming a level.

## Anti-Patterns

Common traps that signal expectations may be set too high, or that you're overestimating how well you met them.

Use this section when **setting expectations** (are we being realistic?) and when **reflecting on feedback** (am I reading this correctly?). If multiple anti-patterns apply strongly, the expectations or your self-assessment may need adjustment.

## Explorer Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Learning ≠ Operating"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Confusing exposure with competence ("I've seen this before")
- Relying on step-by-step guidance but framing it as independence
- Completing tasks only when scope is tightly defined by others
- Needing frequent clarification but not recognising it as dependency
- Delivering outcomes that work only in the exact same conditions

### Red flags:

- Work stalls without close support
- You struggle to explain why something works
- You need rework when conditions change slightly

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Explorer-level expectations are more realistic than Artisan.

## Artisan Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Strong Execution ≠ Expanded Impact"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Mistaking high-quality delivery for broader ownership
- Being the "go-to person" for doing the work, not for making others better at it
- Solving the same problems repeatedly without eliminating root causes
- Waiting for direction, even when you could lead
- Equating seniority or tenure with Catalyst behaviour

### Red flags:

- Impact is limited to your own tasks or tickets
- You execute well but rarely shape the approach
- Teams depend on you to do, not to enable

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Artisan-level expectations are more realistic than Catalyst.

## Catalyst Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Helping ≠ Enabling at Scale"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Acting as a human bridge instead of fixing broken systems
- Being involved in many things, but owning few outcomes end-to-end
- Giving advice that is helpful but not adopted consistently
- Creating momentum that depends on your constant presence
- Confusing visibility with leverage

### Red flags:

- Things slow down when you step away
- Others still rely on you to connect dots
- Improvements don't survive beyond the project

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Catalyst-level expectations are more realistic than Multiplier or Amplifier.

## Multiplier Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Delegation ≠ Multiplication"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Delegating tasks without transferring context or judgment
- Mentoring individuals but not improving team capability overall
- Scaling yourself by adding meetings instead of removing friction
- Driving outcomes through personal authority rather than systems
- Confusing org-level exposure with org-level impact

### Red flags:

- Quality drops sharply without your oversight
- Teams execute because of you, not independently
- Success is fragile and person-dependent

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations are more realistic than Strategist.

## Amplifier Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Building Tools ≠ Scaling Impact"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Creating platforms or tools that solve your own problems, not the team's
- Building systems that require your involvement to maintain or evolve
- Confusing technical sophistication with actual adoption
- Writing documentation that clarifies for you but not for others
- Automating without measuring whether it actually saves time

### Red flags:

- Tools exist but aren't used consistently by the team
- Standards you set require constant enforcement
- Your artifacts need you to explain them

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Catalyst-level expectations are more realistic than Amplifier.

## Strategist Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Direction Setting ≠ Durable Strategy"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Producing narratives without changing execution reality
- Defining vision without aligning incentives or constraints
- Relying on charisma instead of structural clarity
- Making decisions that sound right but don't survive trade-offs
- Assuming long-term thinking without measurable outcomes

### Red flags:

- Strategy exists mostly in decks or conversations
- Teams interpret direction differently
- Results lag despite clear messaging

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations may be more realistic than Strategist.

## Pioneer Anti-Patterns

**Motto:** "Visibility ≠ Influence"

### Signs expectations may be too high:

- Speaking at events without changing how others think or work
- Writing thought leadership that impresses but doesn't get applied
- Building external reputation disconnected from internal contribution
- Confusing personal brand with organisational impact
- Innovating in isolation without bringing others along

### Red flags:

- External recognition exceeds internal reliance
- Ideas are admired but not adopted
- Innovation doesn't translate to capability others can use

**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Amplifier-level expectations are more realistic than Pioneer.

## Universal Warning Signs

If you notice these patterns, pause and reassess:

- "I could do it if I were given the chance"
- "I do this informally, just not officially"
- "It worked once, so I count it"
- "People come to me a lot" (without sustained change following)
- "I'm already doing parts of the next persona"

**Reminder:** Occasional behaviour doesn't reflect where you operate. Consistency, durability, and reliance without prompting do.

## Final Self-Check

Before finalising expectations or your self-assessment, ask:

- If I stepped away for 3 months, what would **break** vs **persist**?
- Is my impact **person-dependent** or **system-dependent**?
- Would others describe me at this persona level **without hesitation**?

**Warning:** If the answer feels defensively justified rather than obvious, expectations may be set too high, or your self-assessment needs revision.
