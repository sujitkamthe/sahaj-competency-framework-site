These personas explain **how Sahaj expects impact to evolve**, not what someone is "allowed" to do. Growth is about expanding reach across capability areas. No single straight path. Different areas mature at different speeds.

The first three personas (Explorer → Artisan → Catalyst) form a **shared foundation**. Beyond Catalyst, the path forks. This reflects the [Trident Model](https://www.patkua.com/blog/the-trident-model-of-career-development/) observation that scaling impact doesn't require leading people:

**Tech Leadership (TL):** Multiplier → Strategist. Scales impact through leading teams and accounts.

**Individual Contributor (IC):** Amplifier → Pioneer. Scales impact through artifacts, expertise, and external influence.

Individual Contributor refers to how you scale impact, not how you work day-to-day. You still collaborate closely with teammates, communicate across teams, and mentor others. The difference is that your scaling mechanism is artifacts and expertise rather than leading a team.
