## Description

Problem understanding, ambiguity removal, solution shaping, stakeholder partnership

## Introduction

Consulting captures the ability to:

- Understand problems beyond tickets and stories
- Remove ambiguity
- Reframe vague asks into solvable problem statements
- Propose options and explain trade-offs
- Help stakeholders make better decisions

This capability area exists because delivery alone has a natural ceiling in a consulting organisation.

Some engineers primarily execute well-defined work.

Others actively shape what should be built and why.

Both are valuable — but they are not the same kind of impact.

Growth at Sahaj requires moving from order-taking to problem ownership.

## Note

This bucket is the clearest differentiator between delivery-only contribution and consulting-led impact. Many people believe they are doing consulting; the bullets below make it very hard to claim that without evidence.
