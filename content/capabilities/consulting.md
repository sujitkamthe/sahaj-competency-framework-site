## Description

Problem understanding, ambiguity removal, solution shaping, stakeholder partnership

## Introduction

Consulting captures the ability to:

- Understand problems beyond tickets and stories
- Remove ambiguity
- Reframe vague asks into solvable problem statements
- Propose options and explain trade-offs
- Help stakeholders make better decisions

This capability area exists because delivery alone has a natural ceiling in a consulting organisation.

Some engineers primarily execute well-defined work.

Others actively shape what should be built and why.

Both are valuable — but they are not the same kind of impact.

Growth at Sahaj requires moving from receiving clarity to building your own. Early on, others share context and direction. The expectation is that you build your own clarity quickly.

## Note

This capability requires concrete evidence. The expectations below describe what Consulting looks like in practice — use them to reflect honestly.
