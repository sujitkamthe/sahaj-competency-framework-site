## Description

Problem understanding, ambiguity removal, solution shaping, stakeholder partnership

## Introduction

Consulting captures the ability to:

- Understand problems beyond tickets and stories
- Remove ambiguity
- Reframe vague asks into solvable problem statements
- Propose options and explain trade-offs
- Help stakeholders make better decisions

This capability area exists because delivery alone has a natural ceiling in a consulting organisation.

Some engineers primarily execute well-defined work.

Others actively shape what should be built and why.

Both are valuable, but they are not the same kind of impact.

Growth at Sahaj requires moving from receiving clarity to building your own. Early on, others share context and direction. The expectation is that you build your own clarity quickly.

## Note

The expectations below describe what Consulting looks like in practice. Use them to check if expectations are realistic and to reflect on feedback.

### What if the Client Just Wants Execution?

Even execution-heavy engagements have consulting moments: clarifying requirements, flagging risks, proposing alternatives when asked to build something brittle.

Consulting isn't about overriding the client. It's about removing ambiguity, surfacing trade-offs, and helping them make informed decisions, even small ones.

If you're waiting for a strategy workshop to demonstrate Consulting, you're missing daily opportunities.
