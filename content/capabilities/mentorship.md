## Description

Growing people and teams

## Introduction

Sahaj is a people-driven organisation.

This capability area exists to make people impact explicit and visible.

Mentorship & Talent Growth includes:

- Coaching and teaching
- Knowledge sharing
- Feedback and conflict resolution
- Creating psychologically safe, high-trust environments
- Building teams that are strong even in your absence

At senior levels, impact is measured less by what you personally deliver and more by the capability you grow around you.
