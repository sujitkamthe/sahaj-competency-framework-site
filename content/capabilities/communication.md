## Description

Clarity, facilitation, reach, and reputation

## Introduction

This capability area captures the ability to:

- Communicate clearly and with intent
- Facilitate discussions and drive decisions
- Build strong stakeholder relationships
- Influence without authority
- Represent Sahaj internally and externally

Stakeholder management, relationship building, and influence live here because they determine reach, not ownership.

As impact grows, communication expands beyond:

- Team → multiple teams
- Project → account
- Internal → industry and ecosystem

This includes contributions such as:

- Community events
- Conference talks
- Hiring and proposals
- Thought leadership
