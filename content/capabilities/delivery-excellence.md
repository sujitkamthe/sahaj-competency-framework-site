## Description

Predictable, sustainable delivery of value

## Introduction

Delivery Excellence reflects Sahaj's belief that:

- Predictability matters more than heroics
- Sustainable pace matters more than short-term speed
- Good delivery is a system property, not an individual trait

This capability area includes:

- Story, feature, and milestone ownership
- Risk management and dependency handling
- Agile practices as principles, not rituals
- Making trade-offs between scope, time, and quality explicit

At higher levels, Delivery Excellence means improving how delivery works for others, not just getting your own work done.

## Note

Delivery excellence is not about speed alone. It is about reliability, predictability, and sustainability. This bucket prevents heroics from being mistaken for maturity.
