## Description

Engineering craft, execution quality, and technical excellence

## Introduction

Technical Delivery captures the quality of engineering judgment and execution.

This capability area reflects Sahaj's belief that:

- Engineering excellence is foundational
- Clean code, sound design, and maintainability are non-negotiable
- Polyglot capability is expected: backend, frontend, data, and infrastructure are part of the same system

Technical Delivery is not about cleverness or volume of code.

It is about building the right thing well, making appropriate trade-offs, and leaving systems healthier than you found them.

At higher levels, this shifts from writing great code to setting technical direction and raising the bar for others.

## Note

This bucket is intentionally deep. Technical excellence is the foundation, but not the sole driver of growth at Sahaj. The bullets below are not exhaustive tasks; they describe habits, judgment, and quality bar.
