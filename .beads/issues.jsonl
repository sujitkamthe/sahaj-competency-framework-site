Editing home.md updates the home page after rebuild\n2. Current visual design is preserved\n3. No manual sync between home.md and index.html required\n\n## Files Involved\n- `content/home.md` - source content\n- `build.js` - may need to parse home.md differently\n- `app.js` - may need to render home page dynamically\n- `index.html` - home section becomes a shell or is generated\n- `data.js` - may need richer home content structure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"karun@japhet.in","created_at":"2026-01-29T20:21:57.337873+05:30","created_by":"Karun Japhet","updated_at":"2026-01-29T20:29:05.85402+05:30","closed_at":"2026-01-29T20:29:05.85402+05:30","close_reason":"Implemented: Home page now rendered dynamically from home.md"}
