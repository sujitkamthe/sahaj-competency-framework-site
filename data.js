const SELF_ASSESSMENT_PAGE = {
  "title": "How to Do Your Self-Assessment",
  "content": "This framework is designed to support **honest reflection**, not optimistic self-rating. The goal is to help you clearly identify where you operate today, not where you aspire to be.\n\n> You will choose **one persona only** and then assess how consistently you demonstrate that persona across capability areas.\n\n## Step 1: Choose Your Current Persona (Single Choice)\n\nChoose one persona that best describes how you operate **most of the time**, across your role.\n\n**Warning:** Do not choose aspirationally. Choose the persona whose behaviours you already demonstrate consistently and without prompting.\n\n### Personas (from early to advanced)\n\n- **Explorer**: Learning the fundamentals, contributing with guidance\n- **Artisan**: Reliable individual contributor with strong execution\n- **Catalyst**: Expands impact beyond own work; enables teams\n- **Multiplier**: Scales impact through people, systems, and decisions\n- **Strategist**: Shapes direction, priorities, and long-term outcomes\n\nIt is expected that growth through these personas is sequential.\n\n### Ask yourself:\n\n- Where do I operate most of the time, not occasionally?\n- Where do others rely on me without prompting?\n- If my role stayed the same for 6 months, which persona would still describe me?\n\n**Important:** You must select exactly one persona. You will not choose different personas for different capability areas.\n\n## Step 2: Assess Yourself Against That Persona\n\nOnce you've chosen your persona, assess how well you demonstrate that persona's expectations across all relevant **Capability Areas** (Technical Delivery, Consulting, Delivery Excellence, Mentorship, Influence).\n\n### You are NOT asking:\n\"What is my level in this area?\"\n\n### You ARE asking:\n\"How consistently do I demonstrate the behaviours expected of my chosen persona in this area?\"\n\n## Step 3: Gather Evidence (Not Effort)\n\nFor each Capability Area, list concrete evidence that shows you operating at your chosen persona level.\n\n### Focus on:\n- Outcomes you owned\n- Decisions you influenced\n- Problems that stopped recurring because of you\n- People who grew or succeeded because of your involvement\n\n### Avoid:\n- Intent (\"I try to...\", \"I aim to...\")\n- Effort (\"I worked hard...\", \"I spent many hours...\")\n- One-off heroics or exceptional circumstances\n\n**If you struggle to find evidence, that is a signal, not a failure.**\n\n## Step 4: Rate Yourself Honestly (Per Capability Area)\n\nUsing the definitions below, rate yourself for each Capability Area, relative to your chosen persona.\n\n### Below Expectations\n\n- You demonstrate some behaviours of the persona, but not most\n- Impact is inconsistent, fragile, or dependent on others\n- Outcomes rely on favourable conditions\n- You often need reminders, escalation, or rescue\n\n**Guiding questions:**\n- Would this area stall without support?\n- Do others compensate for gaps I haven't closed yet?\n\n### Meets Expectations\n\n- You demonstrate most behaviours consistently\n- Impact is reliable and repeatable\n- Others trust you to own this area without supervision\n- You deliver outcomes across different contexts\n\n**Guiding questions:**\n- Would people confidently depend on me here?\n- Does this show up beyond one project or team?\n\n### Exceeds Expectations\n\n- You raise the bar for this area at your persona level\n- Others learn by watching or working with you\n- Your impact extends beyond your immediate scope\n- Problems stop recurring due to structural improvements you introduced\n\n**Guiding questions:**\n- Are others changing how they work because of me?\n- Would this area noticeably weaken if I stepped away?\n\n## Step 5: Look for Imbalance\n\nYour persona choice should be supported across capability areas.\n\n### Key principles:\n\n- Strong Technical Delivery is **mandatory**, but insufficient for growth\n- Exceeding expectations in one area **does not compensate** for being below in another\n- Persistent gaps signal a growth ceiling, regardless of strengths elsewhere\n\n### Examples:\n\n| Pattern | Result |\n|---------|--------|\n| Strong Technical Delivery + weak Consulting | Catalyst ceiling |\n| Strong Execution + weak Mentorship | Multiplier ceiling |\n| Strong Influence + weak Delivery Excellence | Credibility risk |\n\n**Growth requires broadening impact, not maximising a single strength.**\n\n## Step 6: Validate Externally\n\nBefore finalising your assessment:\n\n### Ask peers:\n- \"Where do you see my strongest impact?\"\n- \"Where do you rely on me without needing follow-ups?\"\n\n### Ask leads:\n- \"Where do I consistently operate without support?\"\n- \"Where would my absence be felt most?\"\n\nLook for **patterns**, not isolated comments.\n\n**Warning:** If your self-assessment is meaningfully higher than the feedback, trust the feedback.\n\n## Explicit Growth Principle\n\n**Strong Technical Delivery is mandatory but not sufficient.**\n\n### Growth beyond Artisan requires:\n- Consulting\n- Delivery Excellence\n\n### Growth beyond Catalyst requires:\n- Mentorship\n- Influence\n- System-level thinking\n\nPersona advancement reflects **how far your impact travels**, not how good you are at a single thing."

const ANTI_PATTERNS_PAGE = {
  "title": "Persona Anti-Patterns",
  "content": "Common self-overrating traps. Use this section to **stress-test your persona choice**. If multiple anti-patterns apply strongly to you, you are likely rating yourself one persona too high.\n\n## Explorer Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Learning ≠ Operating\"\n\n### Common traps when rating yourself too high:\n\n- Confusing exposure with competence (\"I've seen this before\")\n- Relying on step-by-step guidance but framing it as independence\n- Completing tasks only when scope is tightly defined by others\n- Needing frequent clarification but not recognising it as dependency\n- Delivering outcomes that work only in the exact same conditions\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Work stalls without close support\n- You struggle to explain why something works\n- You need rework when conditions change slightly\n\n**Verdict:** If this applies, you are still **Explorer**, not Artisan.\n\n## Artisan Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Strong Execution ≠ Expanded Impact\"\n\n### Common traps when rating yourself too high:\n\n- Mistaking high-quality delivery for broader ownership\n- Being the \"go-to person\" because of availability, not leverage\n- Solving the same problems repeatedly without eliminating root causes\n- Waiting for direction, even when you could lead\n- Equating seniority or tenure with Catalyst behaviour\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Impact is limited to your own tasks or tickets\n- You execute well but rarely shape the approach\n- Teams depend on you to do, not to enable\n\n**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Artisan**, not Catalyst.\n\n## Catalyst Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Helping ≠ Enabling at Scale\"\n\n### Common traps when rating yourself too high:\n\n- Acting as a human bridge instead of fixing broken systems\n- Being involved in many things, but owning few outcomes end-to-end\n- Giving advice that is helpful but not adopted consistently\n- Creating momentum that depends on your constant presence\n- Confusing visibility with leverage\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Things slow down when you step away\n- Others still rely on you to connect dots\n- Improvements don't survive beyond the project\n\n**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Catalyst**, not Multiplier.\n\n## Multiplier Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Delegation ≠ Multiplication\"\n\n### Common traps when rating yourself too high:\n\n- Delegating tasks without transferring context or judgment\n- Mentoring individuals but not improving team capability overall\n- Scaling yourself by adding meetings instead of removing friction\n- Driving outcomes through personal authority rather than systems\n- Confusing org-level exposure with org-level impact\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Quality drops sharply without your oversight\n- Teams execute because of you, not independently\n- Success is fragile and person-dependent\n\n**Verdict:** If this applies, you are **Multiplier**, not Strategist.\n\n## Strategist Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Direction Setting ≠ Durable Strategy\"\n\n### Common traps when rating yourself too high:\n\n- Producing narratives without changing execution reality\n- Defining vision without aligning incentives or constraints\n- Relying on charisma instead of structural clarity\n- Making decisions that sound right but don't survive trade-offs\n- Assuming long-term thinking without measurable outcomes\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Strategy exists mostly in decks or conversations\n- Teams interpret direction differently\n- Results lag despite clear messaging\n\n**Verdict:** If this applies, you may still be **Multiplier**, not Strategist.\n\n## Universal Over-Rating Signals\n\nIf you notice these patterns, pause and reassess:\n\n- \"I could do it if I were given the chance\"\n- \"I do this informally, just not officially\"\n- \"It worked once, so I count it\"\n- \"People come to me a lot\" (without evidence of sustained change)\n- \"I'm already doing parts of the next persona\"\n\n**Reminder:** Occasional behaviour does not define your persona. Consistency, durability, and reliance without prompting do.\n\n## Final Self-Check\n\nBefore finalising your persona, ask:\n\n- If I stepped away for 3 months, what would **break** vs **persist**?\n- Is my impact **person-dependent** or **system-dependent**?\n- Would others describe me at this persona level **without hesitation**?\n\n**Warning:** If the answer feels defensively justified rather than obvious, you're likely one level too high."

Some engineers primarily execute well-defined work. Others actively shape what should be built and why. Both are valuable — but they are not the same kind of impact.
