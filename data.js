const SELF_ASSESSMENT_PAGE = {
  "title": "How to Do Your Self-Assessment",
  "content": "This framework is designed to support **honest reflection**, not optimistic self-rating. The goal is to summarize your understanding of feedback you've received—not to claim a level or build a case.\n\n## How This Process Works\n\nYour self-assessment is a starting point, not a conclusion.\n\nThroughout your work, you receive feedback from teammates, leads, and stakeholders. This self-assessment is where you reflect on that feedback and show how you've processed it. The question isn't \"what level am I?\"—it's \"did I meet the expectations my team set with me, and did I understand my feedback correctly?\"\n\nAfter you complete your assessment, teammates from your project and office will respond. They'll confirm your understanding, correct misreadings, or add perspective you may have missed. You'll do the same for them. This is mutual calibration, not one-way review.\n\nEveryone in your office sees these assessments. This transparency means overstating doesn't work—your teammates know your work. It also means you can be honest about uncertainty. Saying \"I'm not sure I've read this right\" invites useful correction. Treating it as a case to defend invites scrutiny.\n\n## Before You Begin\n\nSelf-assessment depends on expectations that were set earlier. If you and your teammates haven't discussed what's expected of you, [do that first](#home/setting-expectations-comes-first). Without clear expectations, self-assessment becomes guesswork.\n\n## Step 1: Recall Your Expectations\n\nBefore rating yourself, be clear on what was expected.\n\nWhat did you and your teammates agree you'd be responsible for? What outcomes, behaviours, or ownership were you expected to demonstrate? If you used this field guide during expectation-setting, which persona served as the reference point?\n\nIf you're unsure, check with your teammates before proceeding. Self-assessment against unclear expectations produces unclear results.\n\n## Step 2: Reflect on Your Feedback\n\nThink about the feedback you've received since expectations were set.\n\n- What have teammates, leads, or stakeholders told you—directly or indirectly?\n- Where have you heard consistent themes?\n- What's changed in how others rely on you?\n\nThis step is about listening, not advocating. Your self-assessment should demonstrate that you've heard and processed what others have observed.\n\n## Step 3: Rate Yourself Honestly\n\nFor each capability area relevant to your expectations, rate yourself: **Below Expectations**, **Meets Expectations**, or **Exceeds Expectations**.\n\nYou're rating against what was agreed with your team—not against a generic persona definition.\n\n### Below Expectations\n\n- You delivered some of what was expected, but not most\n- Impact was inconsistent or required support from others\n- Outcomes depended on favourable conditions\n- You needed reminders, escalation, or rescue\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n- Would this area have stalled without help?\n- Did others compensate for gaps I hadn't closed?\n\n### Meets Expectations\n\n- You delivered what was expected, consistently\n- Impact was reliable and repeatable\n- Others trusted you to own this area without supervision\n- You handled varied conditions, not just ideal ones\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n- Would teammates confidently depend on me here?\n- Did I deliver without needing to be checked on?\n\n### Exceeds Expectations\n\n- You went beyond what was expected\n- Others learned from watching or working with you\n- Your impact extended past your immediate scope\n- Problems stopped recurring because of improvements you introduced\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n- Did I raise the bar, not just meet it?\n- Would this area weaken noticeably if I stepped away?\n\n## Step 4: Summarize Your Understanding\n\nFor each area, briefly describe:\n\n- What you understood was expected\n- What feedback you received\n- How you performed against expectations\n- Any uncertainty or questions you have\n\nThis summary is material for conversation. It shows teammates how you've processed your feedback so they can confirm, correct, or add nuance.\n\n## Step 5: Look for Imbalance\n\nYour expectations likely span multiple capability areas. Check for patterns.\n\n- Are you consistently meeting expectations across areas, or strong in some and weak in others?\n- Persistent gaps signal a ceiling, regardless of strengths elsewhere\n- Exceeding in one area doesn't compensate for being below in another\n\nIf you notice imbalance, name it. It's useful information for the calibration conversation.\n\n## Step 6: Share and Calibrate\n\nYour self-assessment goes to your teammates and office. They'll review it and respond.\n\n**Expect:**\n- Confirmation where your understanding matches theirs\n- Correction where you've misread feedback\n- Additional perspective you may have missed\n\n**You'll do the same for them.** Review their self-assessments. Confirm, challenge, or add nuance based on your experience working with them.\n\nThis mutual calibration is where clarity emerges—not from your self-assessment alone.\n\n## Common Traps\n\n### Overstating\n\nIf your self-assessment is higher than what feedback suggested, you'll hear about it. In an open system, your teammates know your work. Trust their perspective.\n\n### Understating\n\nSome people default to \"below expectations\" out of modesty. If feedback was positive, reflect that. Underselling creates calibration work for others.\n\n### Defending Instead of Reflecting\n\nIf you find yourself building a case or justifying, pause. The goal is to show you understood your feedback—not to argue you deserved better.\n\n### Missing the Conversation\n\nSelf-assessment without the follow-up conversation is incomplete. The assessment is a starting point. Calibration is where it becomes useful."

const ANTI_PATTERNS_PAGE = {
  "title": "Persona Anti-Patterns",
  "content": "Common traps that signal expectations may be set too high — or that you're overestimating how well you met them.\n\nUse this section when **setting expectations** (are we being realistic?) and when **reflecting on feedback** (am I reading this correctly?). If multiple anti-patterns apply strongly, the expectations or your self-assessment may need adjustment.\n\n## Explorer Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Learning ≠ Operating\"\n\n### Signs expectations may be too high:\n\n- Confusing exposure with competence (\"I've seen this before\")\n- Relying on step-by-step guidance but framing it as independence\n- Completing tasks only when scope is tightly defined by others\n- Needing frequent clarification but not recognising it as dependency\n- Delivering outcomes that work only in the exact same conditions\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Work stalls without close support\n- You struggle to explain why something works\n- You need rework when conditions change slightly\n\n**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Explorer-level expectations are more realistic than Artisan.\n\n## Artisan Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Strong Execution ≠ Expanded Impact\"\n\n### Signs expectations may be too high:\n\n- Mistaking high-quality delivery for broader ownership\n- Being the \"go-to person\" because of availability, not leverage\n- Solving the same problems repeatedly without eliminating root causes\n- Waiting for direction, even when you could lead\n- Equating seniority or tenure with Catalyst behaviour\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Impact is limited to your own tasks or tickets\n- You execute well but rarely shape the approach\n- Teams depend on you to do, not to enable\n\n**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Artisan-level expectations are more realistic than Catalyst.\n\n## Catalyst Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Helping ≠ Enabling at Scale\"\n\n### Signs expectations may be too high:\n\n- Acting as a human bridge instead of fixing broken systems\n- Being involved in many things, but owning few outcomes end-to-end\n- Giving advice that is helpful but not adopted consistently\n- Creating momentum that depends on your constant presence\n- Confusing visibility with leverage\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Things slow down when you step away\n- Others still rely on you to connect dots\n- Improvements don't survive beyond the project\n\n**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Catalyst-level expectations are more realistic than Multiplier.\n\n## Multiplier Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Delegation ≠ Multiplication\"\n\n### Signs expectations may be too high:\n\n- Delegating tasks without transferring context or judgment\n- Mentoring individuals but not improving team capability overall\n- Scaling yourself by adding meetings instead of removing friction\n- Driving outcomes through personal authority rather than systems\n- Confusing org-level exposure with org-level impact\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Quality drops sharply without your oversight\n- Teams execute because of you, not independently\n- Success is fragile and person-dependent\n\n**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations are more realistic than Strategist.\n\n## Strategist Anti-Patterns\n\n**Motto:** \"Direction Setting ≠ Durable Strategy\"\n\n### Signs expectations may be too high:\n\n- Producing narratives without changing execution reality\n- Defining vision without aligning incentives or constraints\n- Relying on charisma instead of structural clarity\n- Making decisions that sound right but don't survive trade-offs\n- Assuming long-term thinking without measurable outcomes\n\n### Red flags:\n\n- Strategy exists mostly in decks or conversations\n- Teams interpret direction differently\n- Results lag despite clear messaging\n\n**Signal:** If these patterns apply, Multiplier-level expectations may be more realistic than Strategist.\n\n## Universal Over-Rating Signals\n\nIf you notice these patterns, pause and reassess:\n\n- \"I could do it if I were given the chance\"\n- \"I do this informally, just not officially\"\n- \"It worked once, so I count it\"\n- \"People come to me a lot\" (without evidence of sustained change)\n- \"I'm already doing parts of the next persona\"\n\n**Reminder:** Occasional behaviour does not define your persona. Consistency, durability, and reliance without prompting do.\n\n## Final Self-Check\n\nBefore finalising expectations or your self-assessment, ask:\n\n- If I stepped away for 3 months, what would **break** vs **persist**?\n- Is my impact **person-dependent** or **system-dependent**?\n- Would others describe me at this persona level **without hesitation**?\n\n**Warning:** If the answer feels defensively justified rather than obvious, expectations may be set too high — or your self-assessment needs recalibration."
